Known versions of software incompatible with LedgerSMB:
-------------------------------
The following PostgreSQL versions suffer from a bug which causes problems with 
LedgerSMB:  8.2.2, 8.1.7, and 8.0.11

These versions produce an error concerning wrong data types but the error shows 
that the data types are indeed correct.

LedgerSMB 1.2.15 and higher are fully supported on PostgreSQL 8.3.x.  Earlier 
versions had some issues.

-------------------------------

W3M does not handle the <BUTTON> element properly and does not work.

-------------------------------

Pocket Internet Explorer:
Javascript menus do not work with Pocket IE (on Windows CE).  Use the Lynx 
interface instead by appending ?path=/bin/lynx to the end of the login.pl url.

Worse still, PIE does not support <button> elements.  Where necessary, one can
slightly customize the system to provide PIE support.

-------------------------------

Internet Explorer < 8.0
This browser submits incorrect data when using the <BUTTON> element and is not
supported.  Users of Windows XP and Vista may try Internet Explorer 8 or 
Firefox at their option. Users of older versions of WIndows should use Firefox.
